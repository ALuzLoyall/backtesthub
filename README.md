## Backtest Hub

__Backtest Hub__ provides a resourceful toolkit to run backtest simulations __quick and easy__, be it 

1) single or multi-asset, 
2) stock-like or futures-like, 
3) price-like or rates-like, or even 
4) single-stock-like or multi-stock-like 

Instead of having multiple accessory features, such as etl/analytics/optimizing, backtest-hub focuses on it's core mission, which is to provide users with an efficient backtest engine, letting the decision of which sattelites systems fits better for their own purposes. The project targets professional quantitative/systematic traders and developers, but, literally, anyone interested in it is welcome to use, modify and suggest improvements!

The purpose of the project is to open source the development of a more advanced framework to compute backtests and portfolios than the ones obtained by similar projects such as backtrader, backtesting.py and zipline. It is supposed to have auxiliary projects to carry on financial data ETL (both OHLCV data, but also anything that could potentially be used to generate signals) as well as analtyics (e.g. I use power BI to make analysis about strategies individual and combined performance, correlations, drawdown, etc.).

This project is still in Progress... The core code I'm currently using to run the fund's backtests is confidential and won't be published here, but I'm working hard to make this project available ASAP =)
