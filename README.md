Backtesthub
===========


A resourceful backtest framework, built upon numpy and pandas. This project is an attempt to merge the best ideas of the two python backtest frameworks i've used most: [backtrader](https://www.backtrader.com/) and [backtesting](https://github.com/nashquant/backtesting.py)

Note: The project is still under several improvements. Do not use it without reading the comments!! Important simplyfing assumptions and inner workings are explained in detail.
