Backtesthub
======================


Backtesthub is a simple and efficient backtest framework, built upon numpy and pandas to enable fast calculations, and providing handy resources for quantitative researchers to study signal effectiveness, position/sizing management [both for stocks and futures], orders management with commission/slippage and backtest metrics evaluation. 

This project attempts to merge some good ideas from from the two best python backtest frameworks _imo_ [[backtrader](https://www.backtrader.com/) and [backtesting](https://github.com/nashquant/backtesting.py)], and introduces some ideas I felt lacked on both (e.g. broadcasting, base and asset separation, etc.)

Note: The project is still under several improvements. Do not use it without reading the comments!! Important simplyfing assumptions and inner workings are explained in detail.
