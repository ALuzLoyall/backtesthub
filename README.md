## Backtest Hub

__Backtest Hub__ provides a resourceful toolkit to run backtest simulations __quick and easy__, be it 1) single or multi-asset, 2) stock-like or futures-like, 3) price-like or rates-like, or even 4) single-stock-like or multi-stock-like... Instead of having multiple accessory features, such as fetching/plotting/analytics/optimizing, backtest-hub focuses on it's core mission, which is to provide users with an efficient backtest engine, letting the decision of which sattelites systems fits better for their own purposes. The project targets professional quantitative/systematic traders and developers, but, literally, anyone interested in it is welcome to use, modify and suggest improvements!


This project is still in Progress... The core code I'm using to run the fund's backtests is still confidential, but I'm working hard to make this project available ASAP =)
